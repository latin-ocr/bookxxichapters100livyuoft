VIL-—HANNIBAL'S ROUTE OVER THE ALPS.

Even in Livy’s time, less than 200 years after the event,

“it was disputed by what way Hannibal crossed the Alps.'’

Liv. xxi. 38, 6.)

( There are four passes now used leading from the west
of northern Italy into France. These are, moving from
south to north, (l) the Col d’Argenticre, (2) the Mont
Genevre‚ (3) the Mont Cenis, and (4) the Little St.
Bernard, beyond which lies the Great St. Bernard Pass.
The lowest, the easiest‚ and in Hannibal’s case probably
the shortest‚ was the Little St. Bernard.

Half-way between Lyons and the sea the Rhene is
J'oined by the Dreme. Half-way between that point and
the sea is the village ef Orange (Arausio). About twenty
miles N. ef the Dreme’s confluence with the Rhene, the
Isere joins the main river. At Lyons the Rhene bends
E. at right angles, and from thence runs more er less to
the NE. to its sources amongst the Pennine Alps. The
Allobroges occupied the region enclosed between the
Rhene and the Isere: that between the Isere, Rhene,
and Drome was occupied by the Vocontii in the centre,
the Tricorii on the east, and the Tricastini on the west.

The authorities fer the march ef Hannibal are (l)
Polybius, (2) Livy. The former lived but a few years
alter the events he describes, and had visited the district
on purpose to describe it. The latter lived 150 years
after Hannibal, and had probably never seen the country
traversed by the Carthaginians.

Both Livy and Polybius agree in their narrative as far
as the passage of the Rhene ; and this must have been at
Orange (Arausio) half-way between the Dreme and the
sea. From that point it is impossible to reconcile the two
accounts.

Polybius says that Hannibal, after crossing, ‘⁶ marched
along the river and. after a. journey of 100 miles
began the ascent.” But a march of 100 miles from
Arausio would not bring him to any Alps, whichever
stream he followed. It is almost certain that Polybius
means the Rhene. Probably Hannibal kept along the
