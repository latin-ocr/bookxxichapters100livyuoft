the latter to Rome. Hannibal fied to Prusias, King of Bithynia,
where, being again in danger of betrayal, he poisoned himself in B.c.
133, being over 60 years ot' age.

Hanno, -onis‚ m. : (1) the admiral defeated at the Aegates Insulae
by Catulus, 241 Rc. (2) Sui-named “the Great‚’' was leader of the
Roman or aristocratia party at Carthage, and the sworn foe of the
family of Barca. His hostility arose from the preferment of Hamil-
‹ear Barca to the command in the Mereenary XVar. He opposed the
presence of Hannibal in Spain (cap. 3), and recommended his sur-
i‘cnder to Rome after the attack of Saguntum (cap. 10). He also
opposed the war continually, and it was probably by his influence
that no material aid was sent to Hannibal during the years of his
presence in Italy. (3) Left by Hannibal to protect the coast road
of the Pyrenees, with a force of 10,000 foot and 1‚000 horse. Hc
marehed against Cn. Scipio, on the latter’s arrival, but was defeated
at Cissis, his camp, his treasureS, and himself captured (caps, 23,
60). (4) Son of Bomilcar, despatched one day's march up the
Rhone secretly‚ to cross the river and outflank the Gauls who were
barring the passage of Hannibal (caps. 27, 28). The movement
was completely successful. Hanno continued to occupy impor-
tant commands in Italy, and in particular led the right wing of the
Carthaginians in their victory at Cannae, 216 B.c

Hasdrubal, -alis‚ m.: (l) Son-in-law of Hamilcar Barca, whom
he succeedcd as commander in Spain, R.c. 229 (cap. 2). He was
vharacterised rather by diplomacy than by generalship. He founded
N ew Carthage 228 13.c., and conquered much of the interior of Spain.
He was assassinatcd stc. 221, by a slave, in revenge for his master‘s
death. With this Hasdrubal was made the treaty of 228 Β.ο., by
which the Hiberus was declared the limit of Carthaginian advance in
Spain, and Saguntum mado neutral. (2) Brother of Hannibal, left
as commandcr-in-chief in Spain, where he was engaged for seven
years in conflict with the Scipios‚ Cnaeus and Publius, whom he at
last defeated and killed in two battles at twenty-nine days' interval,
ac. 211. In 207 Rc. he marched across the Alps to bring reinforce-
ments to his brother. The two Consuls for that year, Nero and
Livius, effected a junction in Picenum by forced marchcs‚ and forced
Hasdrubal to an engagement on the river Metaurus, where his army
was cut to pieces and himself slain. So fell Hannibal’s last hope for
the conquest of Italy.

Hermandica, -ae, f. : a chief town of the Vaccaei taken by Hanni-
bal (cap. v.). Perhaps -—- Salamanca.

Hiberus, -i‚ m. (also, Iberus) : the Ebro, one of the largest of the
rivers of Spain. It rises amongst the Cantabrian Mountains, in the
N. of Spain, and after a course of 340 miles, in a S.E. direction, falls
into the Mediterranean. It was fixed as the northern limit of Cartha-
ginian power in the treaty with Hasdrubal, 228 B.c. (cap. 2).
