auctoritate: there were two law-making bodies in Rome, the
Scnate (lma-es), and the Populus in the Comitia. But any law pro·
posed by cithcr must bc sanetioned by the other. Thus a Tribune of
the People could veto a S'mmlns Consultant, · and the Senate had the
right to dis 55011 5 ¹my motion before it could be put to the people. The
right of mn king xxar rested with the people (see supra cap. 17, ᾗ) 4)
th ιῑ of making peace was practically a senatorial prerogativa No
Cons- ul or other offic‹r could make peace on his own account. This

vas what Lutatius tried to do. If 11165 *ame thing were pleaded by
