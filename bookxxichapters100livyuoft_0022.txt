xviii INTRODUCTION.

conquered most of modern Andalusia and Murcia. The
resistance offered may be gatliered from the fact that some
years later, when half of Spain had become Carthaginian‚
it eost Hannibal 22‚OOO men to subdue the few corner
States at the E. foot of the Pyrenees. In 229 B.c.
Hamilcar fell in a battle upon the banks of the Tagus.

He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Hasdrubal. Less
by generalship than by policy, Hasdrubal pushed forward
his father-in-law’s work. He consolidated what was
already conquered, and extended his possessions by amic-
able dealing with the bordei· chieftains. With him the
Senate concluded a treaty in 228 B.G., by which the
Hiberus (Ebro) was fixed as the limit of Carthaginian
extension. Hasdrubal, virtually an independent monarch,
concluded this treaty on his own responsibility‚ and so
gave opportunity to Carthage to repudiate it if she wished,
on the principle followed in Roman treaties (see Intro-
duction iii.). In the same year Hasdrubal centralised his:
power by the foundation of Carthago Nova (New Carthage)
on the SE. coast of Spain, This town, now Cartagena‚
became the capital of Carthaginian Spain. Hasdrubal
fell in 221 Bo, assassinated by a native.

There was only one person to succeed to the now
hereditary power in Spain. This was Hannibal. He had
crossed to Spain with his father Hamilcar, after swearing
at Carthage to be Rome's enemy for all his days. For
sixteen years he had served in the army as a private
soldier, roughing it with the roughest. He did not know
what it was to be cold or sunburnt, tired or at a loss. He
was always the first to begin, the last to quit a fight ; and
was always chosen for the exploits requiring the greatest
courage and the clearest head. He possessed in a wonder-
ful degree at once the “Lightning'' generalship of his
father and Hasdrubal’s powers of diplomacy. He was
now 26 years of age, the darling of the army and of the
native Spaniards. A feeble effort was made by the faction
of Hanno to prevent his accession to power3 but in vain.
To attempt his deposition would have been to provoke a
civil war, and Carthage preferred to wait rather for the
inevitable collision with Rome which this “firebrand of
war ” was bent upon bringing about.
