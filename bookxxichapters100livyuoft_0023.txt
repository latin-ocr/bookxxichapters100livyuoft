TITI mvn LIBER XXI. xix

In successim] Hannibal overcame the Olcades, the
Carpetani, and the Vaccaei, ravaging central Spain from
the mountains of Castile to the Douro. A formidable
coalition of the tribes in his rear, while himself was in the
far N.W.‚ was defeated in a bloody battle upon the Tagus.
He then turned his attention to Saguntum.

Saguntum was an ancient Greek colony upon the
E. coast, due W. of the Balearic Isles, now Murviedro. It
had been founded by fugitives from Zacynthus, for which
word Saguntum is the old-Latin equivalent3 and it was
said that some Rutulians from Ardea, the people of
Virgil’s Turnus, had joined the colony: a story probably
invented to give Rome a pretence for blood-relationship

Here too they were repulsed3 and returned without
success to Rome. But a few days later came the news of
the fall and. sack of saguntum (end of 219 Bc), after a
siege of eight months. A second envoy was at once sent
to Carthage. “ Was Saguntum attacked by the State's
commands, or by Hannibal’s orders alone?'’ was the
question put by the envoy. The Carthaginians were
exasperated by Rome's insolence, a d roused to stand by
their successful general. They refused to answer the
question. “ Then‚’' said Fabius, “in this fold of my robe
I carry for you peace and war. Take which you will.'’
“Give us which you will,’' was the answer. And the
