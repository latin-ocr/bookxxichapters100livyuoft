off the W. promontory of Sicily. Off the most westerly of them,

Africa, —ae, f. : used by the Roman writers as a general name for
the continent of Africa with the exception of the eastern parts
(Egypt and Cyrenaica). The native Africans, or Libyans, in the
immediate vicinity had been reduced by Carthage to the condition of
serfs who paid a tax of one-fourth on the produce of the soil. Beyond
them lay the various Numidian and other wild tribes who were only
nominally subject to Carthage. The harsh treatment alike of the
serf population and the nomad tribes led to continual revolts, and
accounted for the success which attended the landing of Regulus in
Africa, 255 B.c., and of Scipio in the Second Punic XVar.

Albanus, -i, m. (sc. Mons) z the Alban Mountains, E.S.E. of
Rome, about 15 miles from the city. Specially Mons Albanus was the

Alba to Tusculum. Here were celebrated the Ferme Latinae, in the
temple of Jupiter Latiaris (cap. 63).

Algidus, -i‚ m.: a ridge of hills between Praeneste and Mount
Albanus, in Latium. They were famous for their oak woods, and for
an ancient worship of Diana. There was also a temple of Fortuna
there, at which a service of prayer was instituted Rc. 218 (cap. 62).

Alimentus, -i t L. Cincius, m. : praetor in 211 13.c.‚ and pro-praetor
of Sicily, 210 Β.ο. He was taken prisoner by Hannibal, and treated
by him with great distinction, unlike the rest of the Roman captives.
He wrote a history (Annales) of Rome from the earliest times to the
end of the Second Pum'c War, and is quoted by Livy. Much of his
information was obtained directly from Hannibal, αφ, the number of
men who reached Italy in the Carthaginian army, the route, &c.
