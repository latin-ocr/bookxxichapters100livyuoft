day, amid wretched cultivation, phenomenal harvests are
not uncommon. There are numerous rivers in this western
region, though Tripoli and the eastern shores are almost
destitute of water. The general barrenness of Africa and
the contrasted fertility of Cyrene and Carthage were
proverbial amongst the ancients. And while in Egypt and
the eastern parts rain is a precious rarity, at Carthage and
to the westward there is at least a sufficiency. There still
remam, however, on the site of the city, a series of
enormous rock-hewn cisterns which prove at once the need
of economising water, the sagacity, and the engineering
skill of the ancient Carthaginians.

(c) The Town.

The oldest portion of the town was, as usually happens,
the citadel, Bosra (from the Canaanitish, = a fort), or, as
the Latins called it, Byrsa. This was on rising ground by
the seashore, overlooking the Cothon, or harbour district.
To the north and west of the Byrsa lay the city proper,
Megara (Hebr. Magurim), and the whole circumference of
the ancient city was three and twenty miles. Its population,
late on in history, immediately before the third and last
war with Rome, was 700,000 3 and when at the close of that
war it was sacked and fired by the Romans, its ruins
burned nnceasingly for ten days.

(cz) 1ts Origin.

Herodotus says that the Phoenicians emigrated from the
head of the Persian Gulf and founded Tyre about the year
2800 B.C.; and there is no reason to doubt his story. From
Tyre they spread at first north and south along the coast
of the Levant, and gave the name of Phoenicia to that
region—a region which never exceeded 150 miles in length
a'nd :30 in its widest breadth, but averaged rather less than
5 miles in width. They never attempted to gain an inland
power. Trade was their one object, and so long as they
were left at liberty to trade they cai-ed little whether they
were subject to Assyria or Egypt, or any other great
Eastern Power. From Phoenicia they sailed to all parts of
thc Mediterranean. They planted their factories (or trad-
