milibus —sescentis are governed by the prep. ctam repeated.

9. versa refers to the three preceding accusatives, leqiones, milia
peditum, equitem, and is neuter because of the various gendcrs of those
nouns: lit. “ turned in the same direction,'' i.e., to be used in thc N.
and N .W., whither Scipio also was to go.

Cap. 18, §L mittunt: sc. Romani: the various names are in
apposition with leqatos, obj. of mittunt.

publicone: the -ne introduces the question. The direct question
was, ‘'Publicone cons Saguntum Hannibal oppugnavit?'’ Consilio
is abl. of manner.

nobis ε lit. “there issor us a treaty with you.''

ictum: lit. “struck,'' i.e.‚ drawn up and rutified. A iroaty was
