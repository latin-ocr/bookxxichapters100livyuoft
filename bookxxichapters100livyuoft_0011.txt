IL-OARTHAGE.
(a) Its Position.

The city of Carthage‚ now desolate, stood upon the
western shore of the Bay of Tunis, about thirty miles from
the modern town of that name, and a few miles southward
from the estuary of the Bagradas (Mejerda). It was thus
due west of the southernmost point of Sicily (Pachynum) ;
while Selinus on the S.W. coast of that island was distant
only ninety miles from the Heraean promontory (C. Bon),
which forms the eastern side of the Bay of Tunis.

The Bay of Tunis is one of the few safe harbours on the
north coast of Africa. The coast-line from the Straits
of Gibraltar to the Bagradas runs eastward with very few
indentations. Beyond the Heraean headland it tui-ns
abruptly southward toward the modern kingdom o
Tripoli, thus forming the great curve known to the ancients
as the Syrtes (or “D1-ists”). From thence to Suez the
coast is only broken by the headlaud of Cyrene and the
delta of the Nile.

The peninsula of Italy, Sicily,and the Cape of Bon, form
as it were the waist of the Mediterranean Sea, which opens
out to the east into the Ionian and Aegean Sem, and to the
west into the Mare Tyrrhenum or Inferum. Carthage was
thus situated in the best possible position for comnianding
alike the eastern and western waiam-s, and the trade of
Europe, Asia, and Africa, at one and the same tinne 3 and
hei-ein lay the cause of her early prosperity and her mighty
resources of wealth.

(b) The soil, climate, &c-

The whole area of North Africa, from Cyrene, a Greek
colony on the N.W. of Egypt, to the base of C. Bon, is a
sandy desert, admitting only of a very narrow margin
of cultivated coast-line. Tunis, however, and the districts
to the west of Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco (Numidia and
Mauretania) are of a different stamp. Pliny records that
the soil of Carthage yielded often 150-f01d3 and to this
