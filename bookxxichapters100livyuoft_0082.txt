After the conquest of any part of Italy, the Romans secured it by
planting colonies of Roman citizens in several of the strongest
positione, so as to serve for garrisons and forts. The citizens thus
scnt out wcre m0>tly of the poorer class, who were tempted to go by
the gift of land, fort'cited by the conquered people‚ around the colony-
town. Three officers were sent out to distribute these lands (Pres-
re'ri aqris assc'fflzanclis), and the technical term for planting a colony
is deducere coloniam. The colonists retained all their rights as Roman
citizens. The towns oi* Cremona and Placentia lay respectively on
