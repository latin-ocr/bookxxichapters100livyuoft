Mamertinos from Messana led to the First Punic War, but he imme-
diately joined the Romans and remained their firm ally until his
death, 13.c. 218, at the age of ninety at least. He captured three
Carthaginian ships of war when carried towards the Straits by the
current ; and gave information to the Roman praetor which prevented
the surprise of Lilybaeum, and enabled that officer to defeat the
enemy's fieet, nc. 218 (cap. 49). He also escorted Sempronius
to Lilybaeum, and volunteered supplies of men, clothing, and pro-
visrons.

Hispania, -ae‚ f.: Spain. At the date of the outbreak of the
Second Punic War all Spain was in the power of Carthago, though,

beyond a number of faetories on the -coast, she had no possessione, ,

there previous to 238 nc. In that year Hamilcar Barca crosscd into
Spain and founded the Spanish Empire, which was extended by his
son-in-law Hasdrubal and by Hannibal. At this time the Romans
had no influence in the peninsula; and therefore it was an insult
that they should stipulate for the Hiberus (Ebro) to be the limit of
the Carthaginian advance, in the treaty with Hadrusbal, 228 13.c. To
secure a footing also they stipuluted for the neutrality of Saguntum
(q.v.). Spain is one of the richest mineral eountries in the world,
fertile, and famous for its wool. These resources were productive of
immense revenues to Garthage ; and it was with a full perception of
its value that Hamilcar selected Spain as a point d'appeez· against Rome.
The march of Hannibal lay along the Ε. coast of the Pyrenee83 and
it was to secure this road against the maritime power of Rome and her
intrigues with the natives that he took Saguntum, and reduced the
tribes of the Pyrenees and Catalonia.
