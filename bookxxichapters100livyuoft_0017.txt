Then followed a weary succession of sieges, at Lilybaeum
(250) and Drepanum (248), in which the Romans
gradually prevailed, but only at immense cost of blood
and time. But even here they were foiled at last by the
sudden appearance of Hamilcar Barca as General of the
Carthaginians (247 Bc). He seized the fortresses of
Ercte and Eryx where, with his fieet to keep open his
communieations, he could defy the Roman blockades and
siege trains. For five years he did so: and then in
despair the Romans made one last effort for the sea.
They built a new fieet, and with it C. Lutatius, the
consul of 241 Bc, won the battle of the Aegates Insuloe,
and so cut off Hamilcar’s supplies. Resistance was use-
less now, and Hamilcar submitted. A treaty was agreed
upon by himself and Lutatius, by which Carthage was to
evacuate Sicily, give up all Roman prisoners of war, and
pay in twenty years 2200 talents as an indemnity. By
the constitution of Rome, the power of making war and
peace rested only with the Senate and the people con-
jointly. Hence the treaty of Lutatius was not accepted3
and a new treaty was arranged by which the indemnity
was raised to 3200 talents to be paid in ten years, the
other stipulations remaining the same. The Carthaginians
and Romans were to be allies, defensive and offensive‚
and neither should make war upon the allics of the
other.

The Romans had been in the wrong in attacking
Carthage3 and they tried to gloss over their misdoing by
alleging as the cause of the war the fact that a Cartha-
ginian squadron had appeared off Tarentum in 272 B.C. in
defiance of the treaty of :279 Bc. Polybius, however, says
that that treaty contained no clause to prevent the
Carthaginians from appearing in Italian waters3 and in
any case, it was unlikely that a war would have been
commenced to revenge an insult committed eight years
before, and hitherto unmentioned. This is the view taken

by Hanno in his speech (cap. x„ §8) advocating the
snrrender of Hannibal.
