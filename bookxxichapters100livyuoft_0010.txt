foundation to the time of Augustus was no light task, and
Livy had intended to complete it in 15 parts of 10 books
each, or a total of 150 books. It is probable that the last
8 books were never written.

There were no models of style for him to imitate. As
yet, history was a crude subject with the Romans. Thus
far it had been recorded mainly as “Fasti, '' that is, year· -by-
yea1 records of the elections‚ names of the consuls, religious
matters, and the principa] events of national importance.
Traces of this survive in Livy' s al rangement of his history
by yea1s‚a habit which continues even down to Tacitus’
time at the end of the fir st century A.D. It must be
remembered that dates were fixed by the names of the
consuls, and that there was no other recognised method of
keeping count of time.

This division of history into years prevents any con-
tinuous history in which the cause and sequence of events
is properly indicated. As yet, there was no such thing as
a Philosophical History of Rome.

Livy was no critic. He compiled his work freely from
various sources including almost all previous annalists.
He omitted what he chose to regard as needless; aud, in
accordance with the Roman custom, he rarely mentions his
authority for a borrowed passage. Very rarely too does
he raise alternative views or debate dubious points, as in
the account of the Embassy to Saguntum and of the out-
break of the Boian War of 219 B.C. (see caps. xv„

ἓ He did nit dare to verify by personal observation diffi-
culties of geography. Nor was he an antiquarian‚ though
the monuments of a nation are amongst the surest and
most essential data of its history.

His aim was to give, without excess of detail and with
no systematic criticism‚ the annales of Rome from first to
last as a readable whole In this he certainly succeeded,
and his work remained‚ to Rome' s latest days, one of the
books of the nation. Bht he was a poet and a raconteur
rather than a wliter of history, and he cares more for
polished style and taking passages than for accuracy of
detail and scientific continuity.
