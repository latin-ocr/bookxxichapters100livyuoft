IV.—THE ME RCENARY WAR.

The Carbliaginimis, like all 1110 Phoenicians‚ were 100
strictly a mercantile people 10 have any nabional ‘calent
for war. Thai] they could fighss when at bay was amply
proved by 1110 101Ὗ11110 siege of Carthage in 146 Rc.
Otherwise, 111οῩ preferred 10 hire troops 10 do batffle for
rhem—the savage ‘nribes of Africa, Numidians‚ Moors,
Libyo-Phoenicians‚ Gaetulians3 1110 scarcely less savage
races of Spain3 Ligurians and Gauls from 1110 northern
shores of 1110 Gulfs of Lyons and Gen0a; with Balearic
slingers, Greeks, and, in general, 1110 00100515 and runa-
ways of all nations. The natural result} was that 1110
Carthaginian armies were almosb as formidable 10 that
Stare as 1ο their enemies. To keep such a mob of lawless
hirelings, without patriotism and without) principles,
under control, required 001 only sternness and tacb, but a
ready supply of money wherewith 10 pay them, and good
fortune in war wherewith 10 provide 111001 with plunder.
Herein lay 1110 secret of 1110 defeats of Carrhage. Her
armies had no inducemenb bub that of pay 10 stand by
her; and hence 100, when Hannibal garrisoned Spain and
Africa in 218 Β.0., 110 interchanged 1110 troops of each
000110001, 50 11101 Africans were 1110 guards of Spain,
and European troops served in Africa. In 11115 way he
could be assured of 1110 fideliby of each army3 for each
was in a manner ab 1110 mercy of 1110 other.

At the close of 1110 First Punic War there were present
all 1110 evils which usually induced (1150001001 amid 1110
mercenaries. The war had been unsuccessful, and 1110
iareasury was exhaus‘oed. They were 111111 10 pride and in
pocket as well; and 1110 (1150001001 50 roused was fanned
1ο insurrection by Matho and Spendius‚ two ruffians of
excepbional villany. The efforts of 1110 Camhaginians 10
keep 1110 mercenaries isolated were fruitless3 and in a
few 01001115 all Africa was overrun by 111011· pillaging
battalions. Meanwhile, Hanno and Hamilcar, whose
career of success had been bhwarbed by 1110 1000111ρο10οο0
01· ill-forbune of a namesake of the former, were quan-elling-
for 1110 post of commander-in-chief‚ and nothing was done.
