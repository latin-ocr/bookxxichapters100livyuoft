The obJ'ect of the Umvnasrrr CoRRnsroxnsxcn C01,1AEot:Tt·TomA1,
SEmEs is to provide Candidates for Examinations with Text-Books
which shall eonyey sound elementary instruction in accordance with
the latest results of scholarship and scientific research. Important
points are fully and clearly treated, and care has been taken not to
introduce details which are likely to perplex the beginner.

The books in this series have for the most part been written by
members of the staff of University Correspondence College, and the
successful development of the work of that institution has afforded
the authors a thorougth practica] knowledge of the requirements of
candidates for examination.

The editions of me and GREEK Crassus in the Tutorz'al Series
are on the following plan :—

A short INTRont·t·T10N gives information as to the Anthor and
his chief works, the circumstances under which he wrote. and his
style, dialect, and metre. where these eall for notice.

The TEXT is based 011 the latest German editions. and is clearly
printed in large type.

The distinctiye feature of the Nom< is the omission of parallel
passages and controversia] discussions of difficulties, the space thus
saved being devoted to bringing under the learner's notice impor-
tant points of grammar, and to explaining historical and other
allusions. In this way the beginner's attention is confined to
acquiring a sound knowledge of langnage and antiqnities in so far as
they are illustrated by the classic in hand. In order still further to
lighten the task of those who wish at first to devote their whole
attention to the construe, information as to persons and places
mentioned is grouped together 111 an HISTORICAL ΛΝΒ GEOGRAPHICAL
INDEX. By this means, ton, the expense of procuring a Classical
Dictionary is rendered nnnecessary.

The VOCABULARY contains. arranged in the order of the Text. such
words as the learner is likely not to know. The principal parts of
verbs are given. and (when there is any difficulty about it) the
parsing of the word as it occurs in the Text. The Vocabnlary is
interleayed with writing paper.

Two· series of TEs'r PAPERs are, as a rnlc. provided, of which the
first and easier series is devoted entirely to translation. accidonco,
and very elementary points of Syntax3 the second. which is intended
for nse the last time the book is read through, deals wit-h more ad-
vanced points.

The object of. the TRANSLATIONS in this Series is to make the 0011-
struction of the original clear to the learner, and also 10 provido
him with a model of style on which to form his own version: in
other words, an attempt has been made to attain the mean between
an elegant paraphrase and a bald and literal ‘⁵ crib.⁷’

The Publishers will be happy to entertain applications from
Schoolmasters for specimen copies of any of the books mentioned
in this Catalognc. ’
