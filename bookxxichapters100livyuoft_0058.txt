ARGUMENT.

——000—

After some remarks on the ‘maynitucle of the Second Punic
War, Livy describes its oriyin, the character and early history
of Hannibal, and the chain of events which brouyht him into
collision with Sayuntum. Durinq the sieye, a Roman
embassy, sent to protect the town, is dismissed unheard ; and
Sayuntum falls in the eiqhth month. While Hannibal winters
at N ew Carthaye a second embassy proceeds to Carthaye, and
declares war, as the latter State refuses to make any apoloyy
or satisfaction for its General’s action, In the spriny of
218 B.c., Hannibal reduces the Spanish tribes between the
Ebro and the Pyrenees‚ crosses into Gaul, and fords the Rhone
in the teeth of the Volci, who attempt to bar the passaye.
Then commences the passaye of the Alps; and Hannibal
descends into Italy about the ‘month of October, after losiny
an enormous number of men and sumpter-beasts from the cold
and the attacks of the nzountaineers. On the river Ticinus he
meets Scipio, and repulses him in a cavalry enyayenzent. A
little latter, Sempronius, who had been successfully actiny in
Sicily, joins Scipio, and forces the battle of the Trebia, iri
which the Romans are completely defeated. Hannibal is
deterred by stress of weather from crossinq the Apennines, and
winters in Cisalpine Gaul. Meanwhile, On. Scipio has been
active in Spain. The book closes with an account of the
prodiyies in and near Rome, and of the unconstitutional
behaviour of the new Consul, Ο. Flaminius.
