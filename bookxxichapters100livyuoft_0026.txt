banks of the 3110110 1111111 the Iserc was crossed‚ and then
struck NE. so as 10 reach the river again higher up, ah
Mont, du Chat, and so avoid the long bend which is made
near Lyons. From that point, the natural road follows
1110 Isbre, passes through 1110 Tarantaise, over 1110 Little
st. Bernard, and so down into 1110 Val d’Aosta, the
ancient lands of the Insubrian Gauls.

According 10 Livy, after 1100111119,Ρ along the Rhone for
some little way 10 assist the Allobrogian chief (xxi. 31, 5),
then he continued his march, “ not. by 1110 direct route,
but turned off *bo the left towards 1110 Tricastini,
skirtecl 1110 Vocontii, and so reached the Tricorii
and the Druentia ” (iu, ξ 9). If this be the
case, Hannibal must have returned 10 1110 1)Γόωο
from the Allobroges' country, and then struck E.‚—i.e., 1ο
1113 left along the S. bank of that river past Die and Gap,
and so reached the Druentia where 11 bends northward a
little below Briancon. Crossing it t-hereabouts, he would
either pass NE. over 1110 Mont Genevre‚ or SE. over
1110 001 d’Argentiere‚ and so descend, as Livy says, into
1110 land of the Taurini. Ι1 was much by this route that
1110 Gauls under Bellovesus entered Italy about. 500 B.C.
(Liv. v. 34). Both Cornelius Nepos (Vita Hannibalis)
and Strabo support this view.

But, on 1110 whole, 11 3001113 111010 probable thal: Polybius
was right, for the follow mg amongst 011101 reasons. —

(ii.) Livy says (xxi, 31, ξ 2) that Hannibal marched N.
as being less likely so 10 1110011110 Romans under Scipio.

(iii.) The friendly Insubrians, who invited him 10 Italy
and probably acted as his gnides, would scarcely bring
111111 purposely into collision with 1110 11031110 Taurini, and
Polybius declares that Hannibal descended 11110 the
Insubrian territories.

Polybius : the White Rock (still called Roche Blanche) 3
