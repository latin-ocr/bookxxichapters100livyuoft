the popular assembly had a right to discuss more im-
portant questions of government ; but over this a Senate
of 300, and over them again a smaller council of 100,
had complete control. The latter body is stated to have
been created expressly to prevent any one citizen from
becoming too powerful, a contingency which was proved
by the examples of Hamilcar and Hannibal to be not
unlikely. Besides these various assemblies there were a
board of five State officials, a Commander-in-Chief, and
two Judges (Suffetes; from the Hebr. Sheplzet, a judge),
corresponding to the Roman consuls, excepting that their
tenure of office was not limited to a year. The latter
were appointed conjointly by the Senate and the people.

At the time of the first and second Punic Wars, the
government was in the hands of two great patrician
families, that of Hamilcar, the Barcines or war—party,
and that of Hanno, the peace-party οι· Romanizers. The
latter were at violent feud with the former, particularly
after the mercenary war in which Hamilcar had been
preferred to Hanno as Commander-in-Chief.

HL—CARTHAGE AND ROME.

The first battlefield of Carthaginians and Romans was
Sicily. For two centuries (c. 500—300 B.c.) the former
had been fruitlessly endeavouring to drive the Greek
colonists out of the island. In the year of the battle of
Salamis, when Xerxes and the power of Persia were dis-
tracting the attention of the Grecian States at home, the
Carthaginians had chosen their opportunity to make a
gigantic attempt upon Sicily. But at that date Syracuse
was the strongest of any existing Grecian State, and at
the battle of Himera (450 Rc.) the tyrant Gelo annihilated
the Carthaginian army. Again in 339 Rc. Timoleon the
Corinthian cleared the island by his great victory on the
Crimessus ; and when, after his death, the Carthaginians
once more attacked Syracuse, Agathocles turned
the tables upon them by invading Africa, where he
ravaged the whole province of Ca1·thage for four years,
supported by the revolted African tribes (310—-307 B.c.).
