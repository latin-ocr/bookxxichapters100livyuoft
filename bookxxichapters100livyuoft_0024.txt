envoy shook out the fold with the words, “ Then I give
ou war.’'

y The apparent unanimity of the Carthaginian Senate
deserves notice3 but, though it encouraged Hannibal now,
it refused him any material assistance during the war.
With the exception of a little money, probably no supplies
reached Hannibal for the fifteen years in which he was in
Italy. Hanno, who had spoken warmly in favour of the
Romans on the occasion of the first embassy, probably
acquired a fresh ascendancy in the council.

On the fall of Saguntum, Hannibal withdrew his army
to New Carthage for the winter. Here he divided all the
spoil of the captured town, and granted furlough to all
who desired it. In the early spring the army once more
assembled3 and after the performance of some vows to
the god Hercules (ie, Melcarth) at Gades, the march
upon Italy was commenced.

The route lay along the shores of the Gulf of Lyons. It
was exposed to attack from Roman fleets3 and to secure
it, it was necessary not only to completely overawe the
Spanish tribes, but to leave behind a substantial force to
defend it. In chastising the tribes Hannibal spent several
months, with a loss of 22, ΟΟΟ men. Then he crossed the
Py rences, leaving a force of 10, ΟΟΟ foot and 1000 horse m
Spain with his D¹²biothe1 Hasdrubal, with a special com-
mission to protect the coast ioad and line of communi-
cations On leaving New Cmthag σε the whole force had
been 1⁴] 2,(,) OO men, including 12,000 cavah y. The desertion
and dismissa] of a few timid natives, his losses in war,
and the contingent left with Hasdrubal, had reduced this
total, at the Pyrenees, to 5o‚ooo foot and 9‚ooo horse.
When the army at last descended into the plains of
N. Italy, it numbered only 20,000 foot and 6‚000 horse.
Had not war and hardship reduced his men to one quarter
of their original number, Rome must have fallen and her

&story ceased with the first years of the Second Pum‘o
ar.
