4. fieri non potuit ut, &cst Livy finds himself involved in a diffi-
cult) as to dates. Briefly, the facts are as follows:—

(i. ) In cap. 6, ᾧ 1, sqq. ‚ he says that the siege of Saguntum
began in the consulship of Sempronius and Scipio.

(ii.) It lasted eight months (cap. 15, ᾧ S).

(iii.) Hannibal then went into winter quarters3 and then in
the next year started for Italy, which he reached in five months.

(iv.) Now the year of the consulship of Sempronius and.
Scipio was also that of the battle at the Trebia, viz., 218 B.c.

(v.) Therefore, as the same Consuls only held office for one
year, either (1) Saguntum was taken in much shorter time, and
Hannibal at once pushed on to Italy: or (¹2) the siege must have
commenced in 219 13.c., and ended in 218 ae„ and H. must have
pushed on without waiting another winter ε or (3) the siege
lasted for eight months in 218 ac„ but Hannibal did not reach
the Trebia until 217 B.c., which is absurd because Sempronius
and Scipio were Consuls in the battle at that place, and the battle
must have been fought in their year, 218 ae.

(vi.) The true solution is contained in the note on cap. 6, ᾇ 3,
where it is shown that Livy is mistaken in saying that Sem-
pronius and Scipio were Consuls at the time of the embassy from
Saguntum and the beginning of the siege. They were Consules
dmiynati only, and thei ef01o othe true date of the embassy is the
latter half of B. c. 219, and Saguntum was besieged and taken
entirely within that year. So says Polybius. &Livy himself
seems to accept the second alternative (i.e., v. 2) ε for incap. 30,
§9, he again says that the siege lasted eight months,
