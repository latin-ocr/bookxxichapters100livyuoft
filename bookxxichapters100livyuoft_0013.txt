mainland of Greece. By the year 1500 B.C. they had
factor-ies as far west as Sicily and Italy; and in 1140 13.c.
they founded Utica a few miles to the north of the site of
Carthage. About 1000 B.C. was founded their factory at
Gades (Cadiz) ; and round that centre grew up awide and
prosperous commerce, and a semi-Phoenician district
known to the Hebrews as Tarshish. In 853 Rc. aparty of
them, being exiled for politic-al reasons from Tyre, fied to
