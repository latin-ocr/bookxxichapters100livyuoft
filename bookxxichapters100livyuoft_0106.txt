after first visiting Gades, where Hannibal sacrificed to the Phoenician
Hercules, and renewed his vows. At Onussa, Hannibal dreamed of
nis successes in Italy, and at once moved across the Ebro with 102,000
men (caps. 22, 23). He spent some weeks in conquering the NE.
corner of Spain, between the Ebro and the PyreneeS‚ and, leaving
Hanno in command there, he erossed into Gaul. At Iliberri he had
a conference with some Gaulish chiefs, who permitted him to march
unmolested to the Rhone (cap. 24). The passage of this river was
forced in the teeth of a strong body of Gauls, who were taken in
the rear by Hanno (caps. 27, 28). Thence Hannibal marched up
the stream to the junction of the Isara and Rhone, where he restored
to power the elder of two brothers, chief of the Allobroges, who had
been ousted by the young er (cap. 31. ). In ρῑὲιῖίωάθ, the Allo-

biogian provided food and clothing for Hannibale army, and he
mox-ed foi ward to the Druentia. The stream was crossed with some
lifficulty, and the ascent began (cap. 31). It lasted nine da3 s, during
the whole of which the n ttiv es har issed the army (caps. 31- 4353). The

und a halt of four days was necessary ato one spot in order to construet
:t road. Italy was at last reached with about 40‚000 men. Here Han-
nibal rested a little, and exhibited some gladiatorial games to cheer
his men (cap. 42), and made a long speech to them (cap. 43-45). The
Ticinus was then crosscd in the face of the Romans, who were defeated
cap. 46), and, though most escaped, Hannibal succeeded in cutting offa
body of engineers at the bridge over the Po (cap. 47). He then crossed
that stream higher up, and offered battle near Placentia, seizing the
Roman supplies stored at Clastidium (cap. 48). Sempronius now
joined Scipio, and at the battle of the Trebia the Romans were com-
pletely defeated (caps. 52-56). Hannibal now went into winter
quarters, and in the very first days of 217 Bc. endeavoured to cross
the Apennines. He was driven back by bad weather (cap. 58), and
only crossed them at all with great loss. About this time he lost an
eye from ophthalmia. At Lake Trasimene, in the Sabine Hills, he
defeated Varro with a consular army, 217 Bc, and at Cannae, in the
following year, routed the Romans with the loss to them of 50,000
men. Various Italian cities joined him3 but there was no general
revolt from Rome such as he had hoped for: and when the Consul
and Dictator, Fabius Maximus, adopted the policyof wearing him out
by waiting, fighting no great battles, the Italians gradually reverted
to their old allegiance. Hannibal continued to be more or less suc-
cessful until 207 1³.e.‚ when Hasdrubal, marching to join him from
Spain, was defeated and slain on the Metaurus in Umbria. After
this reverse he was reduced more and more to the defensive‚ until
the action of Scipio in invading Africa forced him to quit Italy and
defend his own country, 203 nc. In the following year he was
defeated disastrously at Zama by Scipio, and accepted the Roman
tcrms of peace. In 198 13.C.. Antiochus HL, King of Syria, was at
war with Rome, and Hannibal joined him. Defeated in 190 13.c.
because he declined to follow Hannibal's advice, he agreed to sui-render
