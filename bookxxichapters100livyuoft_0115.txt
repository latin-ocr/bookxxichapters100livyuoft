Rome's jealousy, and was employed as an excuse for commencing the
First Punic War (cap. 10). See also Introd. 111.

Tarraco, -onis, m.: a populous commercial city of Spain, about
50 miles N. of the mouth of the Hiberus (Ebro). It was fortified by
Scipio against Hasdrubal (cap. 61); and in its neighbourhood the
latter surprised a few Roman troops (ibid), inc. 213.

Taurini, -orum, m. ε a Gallie tribe in the N .W. corner of Trans-
padane Gaul, into whose territories Hannibal descended from the
Alps, according to Livy (cap. 38). He found them at war with the
Insubrians; and, siding with the latter, he sacked their chief town,
Turin, Rc. 218 (caps. 38, 39).

Tiberis, -is, m.: the Tiber, upon which stood Rome. Rising in
the Apennines near Tifernum, it flows S.W. into the Mare Etruscum,
forming the boundary between Latium and Etruria. Its course is
225 miles ; its tributaries, the Nar, Velinus, Anio, Clanis, Allia, and
Cremera; and its estuary port, Ostia.

Ticinus, -i, m. z the Ticino, a tributary ot the Padus, which it
joins near Clastidium, some distance W. of Placentia. It rises in the
Alps of St. Gothum, and flows through the Lago Maggiore. On the
W. bank Scipio engaged with the Numidians in a cavalry skirmish,
and was driven across the river n.c. 218 (cap. 46). This was really
the first encounter in the Second Punic XVar.

Trebia, -ae‚ m. : now the Trebbia, a small tributary of the Padus

Turdetani, -orum‚ m. : the most powerful and cultivated people of
southern Spain (Hispania Baetica), occupying the coast between
Gibraltar and Cape St. Vincent. Hannibal sided with them in a
quarrel against the Saguntines, and so got an excuse for attacking
the latter people. This is Livy's version, who says also that the
Turdetani were neighbours of the Saguntines (cap. 6), which is im-
possible. Either the text is wrong, or there was another tribe of the
same name on the E. coast near Saguntum.
