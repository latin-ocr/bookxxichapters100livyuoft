and took the town by storm aster a siege of eight months, at the end
of the same year. Its inhabitants made a bonfire of many of their
valuables, and threw themselves also into the flames ; but Hannibal

acquired a very large booty (caps. 7, 8, 11, 14, 15).

Sardinia, -ae‚ f.: the modern island of the same name in the
Mediterannean, between Sicily and Corsica. Being rich in minerals
it was early occupied by Phoenicians and Carthaginians‚ and was
g'arrisoned during the First Punic XVar by mercenary troops. These
revolted at the end of the war ; and, being reduced, offered them-
selves and the island to Rome. The latter at once took possession of
it, B.c. 288 (cap. 1), and the Carthaginians were then too weak to
resist. The island was formed into a province geverned by a praetor ;

Scipio, -onis‚ m. : (i.). P. Cornelius Scipio, Consul 218 n.e. Spain
was awarded him as his province, and he sailed thither in the middle
of the year, hoping to prevent the passage ot* the Rhene. He lauded
at Massilia, but did not start on his march up the river until Hanni-
bal had already made three days’ advance. A body os his cavalry,
however, met and defeated an equal number of Hannibal's horse.
Being unable to overtake Hannibal, Scipio sent on his brother Gnaeus,
with most ef the troops, to Spain, to held in check Hasdrubal. Him-

for the first time. The Numidian cavalry won the day; and the
Consul retreated to the S. side of the Padus, te wait at Placentia for
the arrival of Sempronius. In the battle of Ticinus his life was
saved either by his sen or by a Ligurian slave. On the advent of the

where they maintained the war until both fell within a few weeks in

Cornelius Scipio Calvus, brother of the preceding, acted as his {effatus
in Spain, 13.c. 218. He captured the Carthaginian camp at Cissis
(cap. 60), and made Roman influence parameunt again between the
Pyrenees and the Hiberus. He also retook Saguntum, and defeated
*a fleet off the mouth of the Hiberus. Being joined by his brother in
217 Β.ο., the two kept Hasdrubal engaged until 211 B.c., when both
fell in battle. Livy's account of these campaigns is probably much
overdrawn3 and it is more probable that the Romans barely main-
