A man who had been a Consul was ‘⁴ Consularis.'’ The true Consuls
for 13.c. 219 were M. Livius Salinator and L. Aemilius Paullum but
these were both absent in Illyria, engaged in a war with Demetrius,
Chief of Illyria (see Introd. v.). But P. Cornelius Scipio and Tib.
Sempronius Longus were Consules desiqnatz' for the following year,
and probably acted for the. real Consuls in the absence of the latter.

ernbassy would, on its return, make a report to the senate (⁴⁴ deferre
