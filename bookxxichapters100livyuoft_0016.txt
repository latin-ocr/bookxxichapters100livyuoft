A desultory series of hostilities followed until 264 13.c.,
when another Hiero was tyrant of Syracuse.

Some Campanian mercenaries—Mamertines, or “ Chil-
dren of Mars,” as they called themselves—had seized the
town of Messina, upon the Straits of Messina. Hiero
made war upon them3 and, unable to resist, the
Mamertines were divided in mind. One party was in
favour of calling in the aid of Rome3 the other, that of
Carthage. The latter prevailed for a little while3 but
the Romanizing party soon recovered the ascendancy‚ and
in their turn sent off an embassy to beg for help. By the
time that it reached the Senate, Carthage had already
come into the field. So good an opportunity of getting
the entraeie of Sicily was not to be lost. The Romans
warned the Carthaginians to keep their hands off, while
the latter prepared to defend their rights. Thus the two
nations went to war to decide which was to have the
privilege of chastising Syracuse.

The First Punic War began in 264 B.c., and ended in
241 B.c., after a struggle of twenty-four years. The whole
scene of action was the island of Sicily and the neigh-
bouring seas, with the exception of Regulus’ brief
campaign in Africa. At the outset of hostilities the
Romans found their supplies threatened, their commerce
destroyed, their coast-lines insulted, and their sieges
rendered useless, by the fleets of Carthage which com-
manded the sea. Hitherto Rome had had no fleet. She
now determined to build one; and by good fortune won
the battle of Mylae (⁴260 Bc). But seamen cannot be
trained in a day. Fleet after fieet was wrecked or
defeated3 and, disheartened by disasters, the Roman
efforts were again confined to a land-warfare. In 255 ΒΑ),
Regulus attempted to transfer the war, as Agathocles had
done, 10 Africa. His success at first was immense3 but,
growing over—confident, he was completely defeated by
Xanthippus, and himself taken prisoner. Every one
knows the story of his being sent to Rome to sue for
peace, of his refusing to enter 1116 city, and his advisin‘.r
the Senate to reject the Carthaff³nian overtures, although
he knew his conduct would 0051 him his life.
